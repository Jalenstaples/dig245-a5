        <h2><strong>Quick Info</strong></h2>
        <p>I had a few family members navigate the <a href="https://www.nike.com/?cp=99736393091_search_%7CNike%7CGOOGLE%7C71700000038284603%7CGN_X_X_X_X-Device_X_Legacy_Core-NikeBrand_Exact%7Ce%7Cc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrub4zJG86AIVIv_jBx2pQwPsEAAYASAAEgLJE_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"><strong>Nike</strong></a> website and
          complete 5 simple tasks:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Locate the men's Jordan sneakers.</li>
            <li>Sign up for a Nike membership.</li>
            <li>Locate women's sports bras.</li>
            <li>Find men's football cleats.</li>
            <li>Find the clearace section for shoes. </li>
          </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="col2">
        <h2><strong>Results (Success!)</strong></h2>
        <p>For Jordan sneakers, both participants found them pretty easily. Either through search engine or viewing the men's tab.
          The sign up was simple as well, considering the sign up sign is in the right corner.
          Both participants used the women's tab to locate the bras.  Once again, not too hard.
          Cleats was probably the most difficult, considering the search engine was needed to find it (both tried tabs first).
          Lastly, the discounted men shoes wasn't too hard. Both looked in the men's tab and found it at the bottom.
        </p>

        <div class="col3">
        <h2><strong>Final Recommendation</strong></h2>
    <p>Nike has a very strong website.  There aren't many flaws
      so the only suggestion I can make at this point is possibly
      creating a more eye-popping font for the text in the tabs.
